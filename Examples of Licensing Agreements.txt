Examples of Licensing Agreements
Licensing agreements are found in many different industries. An example of a licensing agreement is a contract between the copyright holders of software and another company, allowing the latter to use the computer software for their daily business operations.

An example of a licensing agreement in the restaurant space would be when a McDonald's franchisee has a licensing agreement with the McDonald's Corporation that lets them use the company's branding and marketing materials. Toy manufacturers also routinely sign licensing agreements with movie studios, giving them the legal authority to produce action figures based on popular likenesses of movie characters.
